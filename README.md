### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I've (mostly) moved away from using github. I'm now able to be found on [Forgejo](https://git.casuallyblue.dev/sierra).

## Stuff I'm currently working on
- [RLisp (Lisp implementation in rust)](https://github.com/casually-blue/rlisp)
- [Jenny (A Static Site Generator)](https://github.com/casually-blue/jenny)

## Some Projects I'm moderately proud of
- [Compiler and parser library](https://github.com/casually-blue/sierra-compiler-ocaml)
- [SSH fork with xdg support](https://git.casuallyblue.dev/sierra/openssh)
- [Magic the gathering card viewer](https://github.com/casually-blue/magic-rs)

## Libraries I maintain
